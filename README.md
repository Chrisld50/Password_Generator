# Password_Generator

# Description
My motivation for this project was to create a functioning password generator using javascript in an already created html and css that can create a randomized password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Throughout this project I was able to get a better understanding of javascript and how to make applications happen using codes in javascript, such as prompt, alert and return loops. The most difficult part for me was understanding how the javascript should be set up and where the placement for things should go.
